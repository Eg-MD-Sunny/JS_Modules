### </> Javascript ES6 Modules

### </> Description: </br>
Consider a scenario where parts of JavaScript code need to be reused. ES6 comes to your rescue with the concept of Modules.</br>

A module organizes a related set of JavaScript code. A module can contain variables and functions. A module is nothing more than a chunk of JavaScript code written in a file. By default, variables and functions of a module are not available for use. Variables and functions within a module should be exported so that they can be accessed from within other files. Modules in ES6 work only in strict mode. This means variables or functions declared in a module will not be accessible globally. </br>

</> Named Exports</br>
